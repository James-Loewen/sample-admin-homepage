# sample-admin-homepage
TOP assigment to make a mock admin homepage using a combination of grid and flexbox

## Inital Plan:
Instead of following the provided sample design to the pixel, I am going to create a homepage to manage my hikes.

Some of the **Sidebar** links can be specifiers like *Region*, *Difficulty* or *Multi-day*.

The **Article Cards** can be links to Caltopo routes I've already mapped out and the **Trending** section could be links to the about pages for different hiking challenges (e.g., *Catskills 35* or *ADK 46*).
